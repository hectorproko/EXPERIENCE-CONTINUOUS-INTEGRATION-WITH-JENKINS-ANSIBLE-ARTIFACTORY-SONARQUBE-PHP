- downloading role 'sonarqube', owned by lrk

ubuntu@ip-172-31-94-159:~$
```

``` bash
hector@hector-Laptop:~/ansible-config-mgt/roles$ ls
apache  apacheBANK  artifactory  common  dockpack.base_java8  mysql  nginx  nginxBAK  sonarqube  webserver
```

Did this in the Laptop so now we push to get picked by Jenkins and copy to Ansible-Jenkins instance

``` bash
hector@hector-Laptop:~/ansible-config-mgt/roles$ git add artifactory/ sonarqube/ dockpack.base_java8/
hector@hector-Laptop:~/ansible-config-mgt/roles$ git commit -m "roles: sonarqube and artifactory+java dependency"
```

In Ansible-Jenkins instnace

``` bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-94-159:~/ansible-config-artifact/roles$ ls
apache  artifactory  common  dockpack.base_java8  mysql  nginx  webservers

storeCode

Created repo 
https://github.com/hectorproko/ansible-project

At this point it tries to find a Jenkinsfile does not find it and prompts you for  a page to create

This is where we ignore and click Administration

Now we go back to Dashboard we the job (newly create pipeline)




Screen clipping taken: 4/22/2022 12:05 PM
pipeline


Created the Jenkinsfile with echo "Building Stage"


Our ansible-project job has more options



Screen clipping taken: 4/22/2022 12:20 PM
ansibleProject


We are going to go to Configure

Build Configuration tab
We are going to specify the path of the Jenkinsfile




Screen clipping taken: 4/22/2022 12:23 PM
buildConfig

Click Save

Takes us back to ansible-project we get to pick branches we pick the only only one main

Click Build Now to test


Screen clipping taken: 4/22/2022 12:28 PM
branchMain

If we check the Console Ouput of this build we see the intended message
	...
	...
	[Pipeline] sh
	+ echo Building Stage
	Building Stage
	[Pipeline] }
	...
	...
	

So we just triggered this job from regular Jenkins we could do it from  Open Blue Ocean GUI
The logs from Ocean Blue is also reaally good

build

To appreciate the multibranch options we create another branch Create a new git branch and name it feature/jenkinspipeline-stages

Added test stage to this branch

For the new branch to show up Navigate to the ansible-project dashboard and click on "Scan repository now"





Screen clipping taken: 4/22/2022 1:33 PM
scanRepo

We get an nice interface 



Screen clipping taken: 4/22/2022 1:35 PM

Created more stages

Test the branh with new stages in Blue Ocean branch feature/jenkinspipeline-stages

Creating a pull request to merge it to main

Test the job in Ocean Blue using main

Created job ansible-demo of type Pipeline


Now we type script directly to pipeline
You can use the Pipeline Syntax thing
	In Pipeline Syntax I looked for Git and I get to specify

	Steps
	
	
	
	He did not specify credentials

	Now we look for synatx of ansible execution
	
The fact that we installed ansible plugin makes it available in the Pipeline Syntax

Not sure if ssh-add is good enough, we can test it later

We have been in the Pipeline Syntax generating the syntax
